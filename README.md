# msty-docker
This project is heavily based on the work of linuxserver/obsidian which was used as a reference. For additional customizations, please refer to their project.

I had originally created this out of curiosity having examined how the Obsidian project was implementing Kasm, so I thought to try the same approach with Msty which currently does not have an official Docker release, but DOES have an official Linux release. I also managed to get persistent storage working for the application as well.

I'm not a seasoned Docker developer so any feedback or improvements to this would be appreciated. If anything, thank you for checking this out and if anything, hopefully it helps someone ^_^.
